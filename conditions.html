            <p class="description">
              Mental health issues are very common. According to <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.gov/basics/mental-health-myths-facts" target="_blank">mentalhealth.gov</a>, 
              one in five Americans have experienced a mental health condition. More awareness about mental health
              conditions can help reduce common myths and stigmas associated with them. For more information about these 
              conditions, please seek out a medical profesional.

                  from extreme happiness to extreme sadness.  Mood disorders, also known as affective disorders include: depression,
                  Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), or bipolar disorder. For more information, visit <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders" target="_blank">MentalHealth.gov</a>.

                      Although anxiety is generally experienced by everyone at some point or another temporarily, some people
                      experience anxiety on a more permanent basis and often times it does not fade away. Temporary anxiety 
                      may be caused by stress from work or exams in school but people who have anxiety disorders may not
                      have a reason for it. Anxiety disorders may include, general anxiety disorder (GAD), phobias, or panic disorders.

                          According to the National Alliance of Mental Illness, psychosis makes it difficult to discern what is 
                          real to what is not due to thought or perception disruptions. It is very important to get help 
                          immediately if someone exhibits symptoms showing a loss of touch with reality. For more information,

                                  Eating disorders are illness that cause disturbances in eating habits that negatively affect
