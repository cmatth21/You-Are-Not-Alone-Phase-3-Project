        <p class="description">
          The following tools are recommendations that may help you, not only when you are feeling 
          down but also to maintain a positive mood. The mind-body connection is increased for the better with the use
          of these practices ultimately, bringing you back to yourself. They promote feelings of wellbeing and can be 
          of immediate assistance when in a crisis. You can choose one or a combination of these techniques
          and try to build a habit to do at least one a day; however, try not to put too much pressure on yourself.
          Remember to be kind to yourself and have fun. âœ¨

              <strong><em>Mindfulness</em></strong> is essentially bringing your thoughts to the present moment with
              awareness of ourselves and the 5 W's (and 1 H) of our surroundings. With mindfulness,
              we are able to fully experience the who, what, when, where, and how of our current situation.
              The present moment is the only time that matters in essence. When we ruminate on the past, we 
              contribute to feelings of depression.  When we worry about the future, we contribute to feelings
              of anxiety. When we practice mindfulness, we give ourselves permission to remain present where we
              can actively choose what we do. This is the basis for all of the following tools. Once we are 
              aware of what is going on, we are better able to choose a tool that can help us in the moment.
              <a href="https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/" target="_blank">Mindful.org</a> is a great website with more information about 
              mindfulness.

              <strong><em>Meditation</em></strong> is a practice that uses mindfulness and various focus points
              such as being aware of the breath or focusing on specific images in the mind in order to calm the mind.
              Meditation strengthens the minds ability to focus and remain in a tranquil state. Meditating allows the mind
              time to slow down in times of conflict and make better decisions. It also promotes deep relaxation.
              There are many different ways to meditate including: walking meditation, movement meditation, or traditional meditation.
              Many suggest to meditate at least 30 minutes per day but meditating for a few minutes at a time is also helpful.

              <strong><em>Yoga</em></strong> is an ancient spiritual practice that incorporates deep breathing, bodily poses, and 
              mindfulness. It "yokes" all three elements together to promote physical, mental, and spiritual wellbeing.
              As an added bonus, yoga is also an exercise for the body that leads to relaxation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZP34IA0d8LI" target="_blank">Sun Salutations</a> is a 
              wonderful morning practice that can help you prepare for the day ahead. Yoga can help melt mental and
              phsyical tension away. Exercise, which includes yoga, has less focus on the mind but there is still a mind-body connection
              taking place. Exercise helps to build and tone muscles promoting a healthier body.

              <strong><em>Journaling</em></strong>, or the simple act of recording your thoughts is a 
              very powerful practice. It helps with releasing all the things we bottle up inside. Journal entries can be a 
              mix and the good, bad, and neutral experiences, sometimes it is more helpful to have more than one notebook. There is 
              no limit to what can be written. It can be used as a diary, an art book, a schedule, a record of 
              dreams or emotions, you name it. The <a href="index.html#checkin">Self-Care Check-In</a>
              questions on the <a href="index.html">Home</a> page is a good starting point for daily journal entries.
              Journaling is therapeutic and can help identify patterns. It is helpful to go back and read
              entries periodically to see how far you've come or even as gentle reminder of how to get back to
              your "happy place."

              Do you remember what you used to love to do as a child? Sometimes the best way to 
              cope with being an adult is to nurture your inner child. Jumping in a pile of leaves, 
              making snow angels, water balloon fights, spinning around until you are really dizzy, etc.
              Doing these nostalgic activities help you to not take life so seriously. The laughter
              that is brings is sometimes just enough to turn your whole day around for the better.
              Honoring the child inside also assists with healing. At some point or another, we may find 
              that there are some memories that we wish we could go back and change or make better. Maybe 
              there was a time where you could have used a hug from your parents but didn't get that.  
              The late Albert Einstein and many other physicists argue that time is relative and that 
              what we experience as time is just change. The body reacts to memories as if they were happening 
              in the present. You can use this to your advantage. Take the time to reparent yourself and give
              yourself what ever you needed at the time.

             We can sometimes withdraw from others when we are going through hard times. One of the best ways
             to heal is to rely on friends or family, those you can trust. Talking through problems with
             others who may be a support system is a good way to remind yourself that you are not alone. Remember
             to ask for permission to vent before unloading all of your feelings if they are heavy. Make time to 
             nuture your relationships. Sometimes other people can provide insight on things that you may not see.

              Spending time in nature reduces stress and is shown to boost your immune 
              system. Whether it is talking walks through the park, hiking, or walking along the
              sand at the beach may help calm the mind.  It may also allow you to connect with the 
              beauty of life and a higher power if you believe in one. Noticing the small things can
              such as a bee hovering over a flower can bring a high level of peace if you let it.
