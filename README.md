# You Are Not Alone

## Overview

### Hello,  I created this web page during a time of need for the purpose of reminding us that we are never alone in our 
darkest moments.  Whether someone is going through a crisis or just having a low energy day, this site was create in the hope
that it helps bring a sense of peace to the visitor.

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this website. 

The most challenging part of creating this project was creating the breathing simulator modal and the quote generator.  
To resolve the challenges I had with how to create the simulator, I used CSS animation tools.  I had trouble with the JavaScript code
but played around with it until I fixed it.

## In the future, I hope to learn more about UX/UI design to modernize the appearance of the site.

Thank you for visiting and happy healing üôè
