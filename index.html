            This is a safe space. A space where you can be assured that you are
            not alone. Many times, our life's journey takes us to dark, lonely places.
            Please accept this as a gentle reminder that you are never alone. There is 
            a presence within us that is always there nudging us forward but we it tends to get 
            quieter as our minds grow louder through our experiences. Once we learn to recognize and acknowledge
            that presence, it will be easier to access it. I hope
            that this site will help you find your way back to your innerself,
            the presence that is always here with you.

            Everyday, ask yourself the following questions. If possible, write
            down your responses.
          </h2>
          <ol class="questions">
            <li>How am I feeling right now?</li>
            <li>What physical sensations are present in my body now?</li>

            These questions are here to assist you in returning to the present
            moment. When we return to the present, there is a powerful
            experience of self-awareness and self-recognition taking place. It
            is a gentle reminder that your are not alone. Have fun with these.
            You do not have to answer all of them at once. Feel free to add to
            the list.

            Sometimes, we tend to get wrapped up in the past and the future that
            we forget what is happening now. No matter what direction your life
            may be going in, it is always good practice to check-in with
            yourself, the person who matters most in your life.

          <h2>What to do now?</h2>
          <p>
            After you are done the check-in, take a moment to reflect on your
            answers. It would be a good practice to keep a daily record of these
            check-ins to reference later. If you find that you don't feel
            better, please navigate to the
            <a href="activities.html">self-help tools</a> section of this site.
